AI-Powered Strategic Thinking App – Product
Requirements Document
Background & Problem Statement
Business leaders often struggle to rigorously pressure-test their strategies before execution. In practice,
many strategic plans are built on unspoken assumptions and optimistic projections that go unchallenged.
According to a survey of 6,000 executives, only 37% said their company had a well-defined strategy, and just
35% believed their strategy would lead to success . This confidence gap highlights a critical issue: even
seasoned leaders lack tools to critically analyze and debate their strategic ideas.
Traditional strategy formation relies on frameworks (like SWOT or Porter’s Five Forces) and leadership team
discussions. However, these approaches have limitations: confirmation bias, groupthink, and hierarchy can
prevent open critique of the plan. Research from Stanford notes that “all great strategies are arguments”
– they require coherent logic and vigorous debate to hold up . In reality, such constructive internal
debate is hard to come by. Busy executives may skip formal logic checks, and subordinates may hesitate to
play devil’s advocate. As a result, hidden assumptions remain unexamined and logic holes persist until
they cause problems in execution.
Meanwhile, the complexity of modern business (rapid market shifts, disruptive competitors, abundant data)
makes critical thinking even more crucial. Leaders must consider second-order effects and alternate
scenarios, but manual scenario planning is time-consuming and often superficial. Cognitive biases further
exacerbate the issue – teams may fall in love with a strategy and overlook warning signs. An AI survey notes
that algorithmic input can help offset human biases like groupthink and overconfidence . Yet today’s
common strategy tools (e.g. templated “strategy canvases” or slide decks) do not actively challenge the
content; they merely capture it.
Opportunity: There is a growing recognition that AI can enhance strategic planning by acting as a
“thought partner” and challenger. McKinsey observes that generative AI can “play a challenger role to
highlight potential hidden pitfalls or management blind spots” in a strategy . Early tools in the
market (e.g. Strategyzer’s hypothesis tester, or emerging “strategy AI” startups) show demand for assistance
in testing assumptions . However, no solution yet combines a structured critical thinking
framework with an AI-powered adversarial analysis in a seamless way. Business leaders need a reliable,
private tool that pressures their ideas for them – identifying assumptions, poking holes, and suggesting
improvements – ultimately leading to more robust strategies.
Product Vision & Overview
Product Vision: Enable business leaders to rigorously pressure-test and refine any strategic idea through an AIpowered critical thinking partner. The product will serve as an intelligent “strategy coach” that challenges
the user’s plan, much like a top consultant or skeptical board member would, but in a safe, private

interface. By combining proven strategic frameworks with an AI devil’s advocate, the app helps users
uncover hidden assumptions, identify logical gaps, explore alternative scenarios, and ultimately craft
stronger strategies with higher confidence.
Key characteristics of the solution:
- Interactive Critical Analysis: Rather than static templates, the app engages the user in a back-and-forth
dialogue, asking tough questions and offering counterpoints to stress-test the idea (the AI acts as a devil’s
advocate thought partner ).
- Structured Frameworks & Guides: The system leverages time-tested strategic frameworks (e.g. SWOT,
issue trees, hypothesis testing) to ensure comprehensive analysis . It guides the user through these
structures so no key viewpoint is missed (e.g. competitive forces, customer perspective, financial viability).
- Assumption & Hypothesis Tracking: All key assumptions in the strategy are extracted and made explicit.
The user can validate, prioritize, or reject them, and turn critical assumptions into testable hypotheses with
criteria for validation . This creates a clear list of “what must be true” for the strategy to succeed.
- Scenario Planning & Pre-Mortems: The app can simulate what-if scenarios and generate pre-mortem
analyses (imagine the strategy failed – what likely went wrong?). These AI-generated scenarios help leaders
consider second-order effects and contingency plans, making scenario analysis far more efficient than
manual methods .
- Collaborative yet Private: While individual leaders can use it as a personal coach, the platform also allows
team collaboration on a strategy. It maintains strict confidentiality (enterprise-grade security) so users
trust it with sensitive plans. All AI analysis is explainable – the app shows the reasoning or sources behind
critiques to build user trust.
Product Summary: In essence, this product transforms strategic planning from a static, slide-driven
exercise into a dynamic, analytical conversation. It minimizes the risk of leadership blind spots by
systematically applying critical thinking techniques. The outcome is a strategy document or plan that has
been deeply vetted – with clear logic, validated assumptions, risk mitigation plans, and measurable
hypotheses – resulting in greater confidence and higher likelihood of success. The ultimate vision is to make
rigorous strategic thinking accessible and habitual for any business leader, akin to having a virtual “red
team” or consultant on demand.
Target Users and Market Entry Strategy
This solution could benefit a range of users who regularly formulate business strategies. We have identified
several potential user segments and evaluated them as initial target markets (“wedges”):
1. Corporate Strategy & Innovation Teams: Strategy executives and corporate planners in mid-tolarge enterprises (e.g. a Fortune 1000 company’s strategy department or an innovation lab). Need:
They are responsible for crafting growth strategies, market entry plans, etc., and have to vet these
plans thoroughly. Large companies often have resources, but their strategy formation can be slow
and political. An AI tool could accelerate analysis and foster frank examination of ideas that junior
team members might not voice. Pros: Clear ROI if it prevents a strategic misstep; budget available
for enterprise tools; high-stakes decisions are made here regularly. C-level leaders are increasingly
seeking AI to improve strategic planning rigor . Cons: Longer sales cycle (enterprise
procurement), may prefer consulting or internal tools initially. Data security is a must-have for this
segment.

2. Management Consultants & Advisors: Consultants at firms (e.g. McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte) or
independent strategic advisors. Need: They pressure-test client strategies as a core service. The tool
could serve as a “coach” to consultants themselves – double-checking their logic or generating
alternative recommendations – and even as a deliverable to clients (to show a rigorous process was
followed). Pros: They immediately grasp the value of structured critical thinking and already use
hypothesis-driven methods. A consultant could use this daily to prepare for client meetings,
increasing their quality of output. Cons: Not our chosen wedge – Consultants might be skeptical of
a product that partially automates what they do (cannibalization concern). They also have deeply
ingrained own methods and may trust their personal expertise over an AI’s suggestions. Adoption
might be niche unless the tool is positioned clearly as enhancing their work (not replacing it). We will
not focus on this segment first, but we anticipate some consultants may organically adopt it once it’s
proven elsewhere.
3. Startup Founders and Small Business Owners: Entrepreneurs who are developing business
models, pivots, or product strategies. Need: They often lack experienced strategists or robust
feedback on their ideas. The failure rate of startups is high partly because assumptions about
market demand or unit economics go untested. An AI strategy advisor could help a founder validate
their business idea against market data and common pitfalls . Pros: Huge potential user base;
they are agile and hungry for guidance; a tool that saves them from a major mistake (e.g. launching
a product no one wants) is extremely valuable. Some “Validator AI” tools already target this space,
providing feedback on startup ideas via market simulation , which shows demand in this
segment. Cons: Many early-stage founders are budget-constrained – willingness to pay might be
low, requiring a freemium or low-cost model. Also, some entrepreneurs are overconfident and may
not seek critique tools proactively. This segment is likely better reached after building credibility and
perhaps via incubators or VC networks rather than as the very first go-to-market focus.
4. Functional Business Leaders (GMs, Product Heads, Marketing VPs in Tech SMEs): Leaders of
business units or departments (especially in tech or SaaS companies) who frequently make strategic
decisions like entering a new market, changing pricing strategy, or launching a new product line.
Need: They operate without large strategy teams but face complex decisions. For example, a VP of
Product at a SaaS company planning an upmarket move could use the app to test assumptions
about enterprise customer needs and competitive response. Pros: These leaders have P&L
responsibility and feel direct pain if a strategy fails. They are often data- and tech-savvy, likely early
adopters of AI tools. The use case is frequent (every quarter or for each major initiative) so
engagement could be high. Cons: They are a somewhat fragmented group to target; messaging
needs to be role-specific (e.g. “AI coach for product strategy” vs “for marketing strategy” though the
core product is same). We might initially pick a sub-domain (e.g. product strategy in mid-size tech
firms) for focused marketing.
Recommended Wedge: Our primary wedge market will be strategy teams and strategy-minded leaders
in mid-market and large companies (Segment #1 and a subset of #4). Specifically, we’ll target roles like
Head of Strategy/Planning, Chief of Staff, VP of Strategy or Business Operations, and Business Unit GM in tech
and finance industries (who have high change velocity). This segment has a high pain point (complex
strategic decisions with big stakes), budget/power to adopt new solutions, and is increasingly open to AI
in decision-making . We will position the product as a way to avoid costly strategic missteps and save
time in analysis – essentially an “insurance policy” and productivity booster for strategy formulation.

As a secondary early adopter group, we will also engage high-growth startup leadership teams (Series B/
C stage founders, heads of product/GTM) via partnerships with accelerator and VC programs. This can drive
usage and success stories (e.g. “AI tool saved us from a bad go-to-market assumption, potentially saving
$500k”). Success in these wedges will create credibility and word-of-mouth, after which we can expand into
broader enterprise and other verticals.
User Stories & Use Cases
To illustrate how users will interact with the app, here are a few representative user scenarios:
Use Case 1: “New Market Entry Plan – Devil’s Advocate Review.” Persona: Director of Strategy at a
SaaS company. Situation: She has drafted a plan to expand the company’s software into a new
industry vertical. Before presenting to the executive team, she uses the app to upload her strategy
document (or input the key points). The app analyzes the plan and engages in a Q&A: “You project
20% market share in 2 years – what assumptions drive that figure? Have you considered how incumbents
might respond with price cuts?” It highlights assumptions (e.g. rapid customer adoption, weak
competitor response, sales hiring ramp-up) and asks her to verify or adjust them. It then generates a
Pre-Mortem Report: “Imagine it’s 2027 and this expansion failed – reasons might include: a new
competitor undercut pricing, regulatory hurdles in the new industry, and misjudged customer
requirements.” Seeing this, she realizes she hadn’t researched regulatory risk deeply. She adjusts the
plan (adding a regulatory expert to the team and a hypothesis to test customer requirements with a
pilot program). The app suggests a few experiments (e.g. run a small marketing campaign to gauge
interest in that vertical) and tracks these as hypotheses. Now armed with a thoroughly vetted plan –
with explicit assumptions and mitigation steps – she confidently presents it, preemptively addressing
questions the execs might raise (many of which the app had surfaced).
Use Case 2: “Product Strategy Pivot – Team Brainstorm and Critique.” Persona: A startup CEO and
her Head of Product are considering a pivot to a freemium model. Situation: They initiate a
collaborative session in the app, describing their pivot idea. The app maps out their strategy logic:
“We will offer a free tier to drive user acquisition, then convert 5% to paid within 3 months, which will
increase overall revenue.” The AI identifies critical assumptions here: (1) Users will find enough
value in free tier to sign up, (2) 5% conversion is achievable, (3) The economics still work out with a
free tier. It asks the team to provide any data or reasoning for these points. The CEO realizes they
have no evidence for the 5% conversion – it’s a guess. The app’s framework coach kicks in with a
quick SWOT analysis prompt on the freemium idea. Together, they fill strengths (e.g. lower barrier
to entry), weaknesses (e.g. could attract non-paying users who strain support), etc. The AI
challenger then poses debate questions drawn from this SWOT: “How will we handle support costs for
free users (Threat)? Could offering a free tier dilute our premium brand image (Weakness)?” This sparks
internal debate between the CEO and Head of Product via commenting in the app. They adjust the
strategy (they decide to implement limited support for free users to control costs, and add an
assumption that brand dilution won’t occur if premium features are clearly differentiated – which
they flag to validate via a user survey). After this session, the team has a much clearer plan, with
fewer blind spots and a list of follow-up actions. The CEO exports an “Assumption Register” from
the app to share with her board, demonstrating the due diligence done.
Use Case 3: “Quarterly Strategy Review – Continuous Learning.” Persona: Chief Operating Officer
of a mid-size ecommerce company. Situation: Each quarter, the COO revisits strategic initiatives. He
•
•
•

uses the app as a continuing guide. For an initiative started last quarter (launching international
shipping), he inputs updated metrics (conversion rates, delivery times) into the app’s hypothesis
tracker. The app compares expected vs actual results and alerts: “Hypothesis that ‘international
demand would offset higher shipping costs’ is not yet supported – uptake in new markets is 50% below
plan.” It suggests “Consider if higher shipping cost is deterring customers – perhaps test a free shipping
promo”. For the upcoming quarter, the COO then drafts a strategy to improve international adoption.
The app’s communicator feature helps him generate a one-page strategy narrative summarizing
the refined plan and rationale, which he can present to the team. (Note: This use case hints at future
functionality for execution monitoring and iterative learning.)
These scenarios demonstrate how the product can be used at multiple stages of the strategy lifecycle:
initial development, collaborative refinement, and ongoing adaptation. In all cases, the app serves to
surface the truth – whether it’s an unsupported assumption, a possible failure mode, or simply prompting
the team to think from different angles – and thereby improves the quality of the strategic thinking and the
plan.
Core Features and Requirements
1. Assumption Extraction & Mapping
Requirement: The system will automatically identify and list key assumptions in the user’s input strategy
description.
Description: Users can input their strategy in various forms – e.g. a written proposal, answers to a
structured questionnaire, or even bullet points of a plan. The AI will parse this input using NLP to
detect statements that sound like assumptions, predictions, or conditions. For example, phrases like
“we expect…”, “will achieve X by doing Y…”, “customers will prefer…”, “assuming that…” are flagged. Each
assumed fact or cause-effect claim is extracted (with its context) and presented in an “Assumptions
Dashboard.”
Mapping & Categorization: The app categorizes assumptions into areas such as Desirability
(market/customer assumptions), Feasibility (operational/technical assumptions), and Viability
(financial/business model assumptions), aligning with innovation best practices . This helps
users see where their riskiest leaps of faith are – e.g. a desirability assumption might be “Customers
want feature A enough to pay 20% more,” a feasibility assumption might be “We can develop this
technology in 6 months,” etc. Users can add any assumption the AI missed, or remove ones that aren’t
actually assumptions.
Risk Level & Prioritization: The tool will prompt the user to rank the criticality of each assumption
(e.g. “Would this being false kill the strategy?”) and estimate uncertainty (how confident they are
that it’s true). This mirrors an assumption mapping exercise where you focus on the assumptions that
are both most critical and most uncertain . The app can visually plot assumptions on a 2x2 matrix
(Critical vs. Confidence) to highlight “high-risk assumptions” that need the most attention.
Outcome: By the end of this step, the user has a clear, explicit list of their strategy’s assumptions,
prioritized by which ones could make or break the plan. This list becomes the foundation for further
testing and analysis. As Strategyzer’s Alex Osterwalder suggests, identifying the riskiest assumptions
up front is the first step “before executing on your business” . Our app ensures no major
assumption stays hidden or implicit.

Acceptance Criteria: Given a user input describing a strategy, the system should display a list of extracted
assumptions, each tagged by category. The user should be able to confirm or edit these. At least 90% of
significant assumptions present in a test input should be captured by the AI (measured during testing with
known sample plans). The user should be able to prioritize these assumptions through a simple UI (dragand-drop ranking or rating sliders).
2. “Devil’s Advocate” AI Challenger
Requirement: The product will include an AI-driven critical questioning module that challenges the
strategy by asking probing questions and surfacing potential flaws or counterarguments.
Description: Once assumptions are mapped (or even before, during initial input), the user can
initiate a Challenger Q&A session. In this mode, the AI agent takes on the persona of a skeptical
reviewer (yet constructive and professional in tone). It will ask a series of pointed questions about
the strategy. These questions are derived from a combination of:
Generic critical thinking prompts (e.g. “What if the opposite is true?”, “Why do we believe this will
hold?”),
The specific content of the strategy (e.g. if a plan hinges on a single partner, “What if that partner falls
through?”; if aggressive growth is projected, “What if growth is half of expectations?”).
Known strategic frameworks and checklists (e.g. Porter’s Five Forces: “Have you considered how
competitors or new entrants will react?”; Risk checklists: “What legal or regulatory risks could impact this
plan?”).
Adaptive Dialogue: The user can answer the AI’s questions or adjust their plan in response. The AI
will drill deeper based on the user’s responses. For instance, if the user justifies an assumption (“We
have data showing customer interest”), the AI might then ask to see the data or question its
applicability (“Is that data from the same customer segment we’re targeting?”). This iterative
interrogation continues until major areas have been covered. The tone will be akin to a rigorous but
helpful consultant or a board member who deeply cares about due diligence. The goal is to
simulate a “red team” exercise: pressure-testing the strategy from all angles in a conversational
manner. As McKinsey notes, AI can serve as a brainstorming partner that counters leaders’ biases
and blind spots by playing this challenger role .
Knowledge Base & Context: The challenger draws on a knowledge base of common strategic
pitfalls (for example, if the strategy is a pricing change, the AI knows typical pitfalls like igniting
price wars or eroding brand value, and will ask about those). If connected to external data or an
internal library, it can also cite relevant benchmarks or examples (e.g., “In past cases, entering Market
X took longer than expected – how does that influence your timeline?”). Initially, even without live data
integration, the AI can rely on its training (fine-tuned on business case studies and strategy
literature) to ask contextually relevant questions.
Output/Logging: The Q&A exchange is logged and key challenges are summarized. The app might
produce a “Challenge Report” listing the toughest questions posed and whether the strategy has
good answers for them. Any question the user cannot satisfactorily answer is essentially a red flag
to address. This report can be used by the user as a preparation guide for real presentations (since
many questions resemble what critical stakeholders would ask).
Acceptance Criteria: The AI challenger should generate a comprehensive set of at least, say, 10 critical
questions for a given strategy input (exact number configurable by strategy length). In user testing, at least
80% of users should agree that the AI surfaced “at least one important question or issue they hadn’t fully
considered.” The dialogue interface should allow the user to iteratively respond and see follow-up questions.

Users should be able to mark any question as resolved (if they’re confident in the answer) or unresolved,
and unresolved items should be highlighted in the final summary. The AI’s tone must be configurable (e.g.
moderate vs. very skeptical) to match the user’s preference, ensuring it’s constructive, not combative (a
too-negative tone could turn users off).
3. Pre-Mortem Scenario Generator
Requirement: Provide a feature to simulate future scenarios, especially generating pre-mortems (failure
scenarios) and alternative outcomes, to broaden the user’s perspective on risk and opportunity.
Description: Users can activate a Pre-Mortem Analysis mode. They specify a future time horizon
(e.g. 1 year, 3 years ahead) and ask the AI to imagine that the strategy has failed (or succeeded, for
opportunity scenarios). The AI then produces a narrative scenario describing “It’s 2027, and the
strategy did not achieve its goals because…” followed by a list of plausible reasons or events. These
reasons directly tie back to elements of the strategy and its assumptions. For example, it might say:
“International expansion failed because regulatory approval took 2 extra years, a new competitor undercut
our prices in Europe, and our product didn’t localize well to regional needs.” Each failure point
corresponds to an assumption being wrong (perhaps we assumed no fast competitor response, or
we didn’t plan for regulatory delay). This effectively flips the perspective (an inversion technique in
critical thinking) to find weaknesses .
Multiple Scenarios: The tool can generate multiple distinct scenarios – not just the failure case. For
instance: a worst-case scenario, an expected/base case, and a best-case scenario could be
outlined. Alternatively, scenarios can explore different combinations of key uncertainties. This is akin
to traditional scenario planning but accelerated by AI. The user can specify which uncertainties to
toggle (e.g. “show me a scenario where customer demand is far below expectations” or “scenario where a
major geopolitical event occurs”). The AI’s generative strength can paint these stories quickly, which
would otherwise take strategists considerable time to develop manually. According to industry
insights, AI-driven scenario modeling enables forecasting of multiple futures with agility – our
product will make this accessible even to non-analysts.
Simulation Data (future enhancement): In later versions, we may integrate actual data or models
(e.g. financial models or system dynamics simulations) to quantify scenarios. In V1, the focus is
qualitative and logic-based scenarios, which are still extremely valuable for spotting overlooked
factors. The app might integrate simple numeric assumptions (like market size, growth rates) that
the user provides, and then vary them (like “what if growth is 0% instead of 5% CAGR?” – and show the
impact).
Result & Usage: The Pre-Mortem report lists each imagined cause of failure as an actionable
insight (essentially, things to mitigate or contingency-plan for). For example, if “key partner
withdraws” comes up, the user knows to develop a backup partner or build that capability internally.
The user can add any of these as new assumptions to track or risks to monitor. This feature basically
forces second-order thinking: considering not just the immediate plan, but how the environment
and chain reactions could affect it. It’s far better to encounter these “what ifs” in a simulation than in
reality when it’s too late.
Acceptance Criteria: For a given strategy input, the pre-mortem generator should output at least one
detailed failure scenario narrative containing 3-5 concrete failure reasons. These reasons should align with
(or at least not contradict) the known facts of the strategy. In tests, users should report that the scenario
content is plausible and thought-provoking. Ideally, more than 70% of beta users say this feature revealed a
risk they hadn’t documented in their original plan. The interface should allow users to tweak assumptions

and re-run scenarios (e.g. “if we mitigate risk X, show a modified scenario”). Over time, accuracy can be refined
by comparing scenario predictions to real outcomes (for iterative improvement, though that’s long-term).
4. Strategic Framework Guidance (Framework Coach)
Requirement: Incorporate a library of structured thinking frameworks and have the AI guide users
through applying them to their specific situation. This ensures comprehensive analysis through multiple
lenses.
Description: Users may not always know which framework to use or how to apply it. The app will
suggest relevant frameworks based on the context of the strategy and then help fill them out. Key
frameworks and methodologies include:
SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats): If the user is evaluating a single
strategy or business, the AI can prompt for inputs in each of the four categories. It might prepopulate some elements from the strategy description (e.g. if user’s plan text mentions “strong
distribution network,” the AI suggests that as a Strength). Once a SWOT table is compiled, the AI
checks if the strategy leverages strengths, addresses weaknesses, capitalizes on opportunities, and
defends against threats. If not, it flags misalignments (e.g. “Threat: new competitor tech – but strategy
doesn’t mention a response to that”).
Porter’s Five Forces: Particularly for market entry or competitive strategy, the app can walk the user
through each force (Rivalry, Buyer Power, Supplier Power, Threat of New Entrants, Threat of
Substitutes) with questions. The AI can even fill in general industry info if available (or ask the user if
unknown). This ensures the user has considered the competitive dynamics. The output could be a
summary of how each force impacts the strategy and any concerns (e.g. “Buyer power is high due to
few large customers – strategy should account for potential price pressure.”).
Issue Trees/Logic Trees: For complex problems, the AI can help build an issue tree (MECE
breakdown of the problem). For example, if the strategic question is “Why are we losing market
share?”, the AI might propose a tree: Product issues vs Marketing issues vs External factors, then
prompt the user to dive into each. This helps structure root-cause analysis logically. NexStrat’s
approach of suggesting frameworks like SWOT or an Issue Tree to structure decision-making
shows the value of this functionality .
“What Would Have to Be True” Hypothesis Framings: Borrowing from strategic coach Roger
Martin’s method, the app can flip any strategic option into a set of conditions that must hold true.
For instance, for a strategy “enter the premium segment,” the conditions might be: Customers in that
segment value our brand, we can develop premium features, we can sell at higher price profitably. The AI
helps list these conditions (which are essentially assumptions stated positively) and then asks the
user to assess each one. This fosters a collaborative, possibility-driven debate rather than adversarial
argument , complementing the devil’s advocate feature.
Financial Modeling Basics: While not a full spreadsheet tool, the AI can prompt for key financial
assumptions (market size, pricing, cost) and sanity-check them. E.g., “Your plan implies acquiring 50K
customers at $100 CAC each, which is $5M spend – do you have budget for this?” If numbers are
provided, the AI will do quick calculations to ensure consistency (like unit economics checks).
Other Mental Models: Users can also select mental models like First Principles (challenge every
assumption to fundamental truths), Second-Order Consequences (we integrate this in scenario
planning), Inversion (we integrate via pre-mortem), or even Bayesian Thinking (update
probabilities as new data comes in, which could be part of hypothesis testing feedback). These are
woven into how the AI formulates questions and prompts.

Framework Selection UX: The app will have a “Frameworks” library/panel. It might automatically
recommend one or two based on keywords in the strategy (e.g. mention of “competition” triggers
Five Forces suggestion). Users can also manually choose a framework to explore. The AI then guides
them step-by-step, possibly through a chat or form interface that populates a visual (like a SWOT
quad chart or a five-forces diagram). The goal is to avoid overwhelming the user – we make it
optional and context-aware. Advanced users can dive into multiple frameworks; a novice might
just follow one guided analysis if needed.
Integration of Results: Insights derived from these frameworks loop back into the main strategy
analysis. For example, if a Threat identified in SWOT is significant, the AI challenger will make sure to
include a question about it in the Q&A. If a Five Forces analysis reveals high supplier power, the app
might prompt the user to add a mitigation strategy for that (or at least note it as a risk). Thus, the
frameworks aren’t siloed exercises; they enrich the central logic of the plan.
Acceptance Criteria: The app should support at least the top 3-4 frameworks (SWOT, Five Forces,
hypothesis mapping, issue tree) in the initial release. For each, user testing should confirm that the
guidance is clear and helpful – e.g. at least 80% of users who tried the framework feature were able to
complete an analysis and found value in the results. The AI’s suggestions within frameworks should be
mostly relevant; if the AI auto-fills parts of a SWOT, those suggestions should feel reasonable (with an
option to discard if not). The framework outputs (like a completed SWOT matrix) should be available for
export or inclusion in the final strategy report. Importantly, using a framework should indeed surface new
insights or ensure thoroughness – we can measure that by seeing if users identify fewer “missed
considerations” when they’ve gone through recommended frameworks (a qualitative metric initially).
5. Hypothesis Formulation & Testing Module
Requirement: Enable users to turn key assumptions into testable hypotheses and get guidance on how to
validate or invalidate them, promoting an evidence-based strategy development process.
Description: Building on the earlier Assumption Mapping, the user can select any high-priority
assumption and click “Formulate Hypothesis.” The app will help rephrase the assumption as a clear
hypothesis with a measurable outcome. For example, an assumption “Customers will prefer our
product’s new feature over competitors’” becomes a hypothesis: “If we offer Feature X, at least 40% of
trial users will choose our product over the competitor’s within 3 months”. This phrasing has a testable
metric (40% trial user preference in 3 months). The app might utilize a template for hypothesis
statements (akin to Strategyzer’s Test Card which uses We believe [target] will [outcome] because
[assumption] format ).
Suggested Tests: For each hypothesis, the tool will suggest one or more experiments or research
tasks to validate it. Continuing the example, it might suggest: “Conduct a A/B test with a subset of
users where only half get Feature X, measure upgrade rates” or “Interview 10 potential customers about
how they choose between products and see if Feature X influences them.” In another case, if the
hypothesis is about market size, it might suggest gathering market research reports or running a
landing page smoke test. The suggestions can be drawn from a library of validation techniques
(user interviews, surveys, prototypes, pilot programs, data analysis, etc.), possibly inspired by lean
startup methodology. Each test suggestion will include what metric to collect and what criterion
would confirm or refute the hypothesis (e.g. “If fewer than 20% choose our product, this assumption
may be false – consider pivot”).
•

Hypothesis Dashboard: All hypotheses are listed with their status: Not Tested, In Progress,
Validated, or Invalidated. The user (or team members) can manually update these statuses as they
run tests in the real world. While the actual experiments happen outside the app, the app serves as
the tracking and single source of truth for strategic assumptions. Over time, this becomes a
knowledge base of what has been learned about the business. For team use, one could assign
hypothesis tests to team members (e.g. “Alice owns testing Hypothesis A by Aug 30”). This is similar to
Strategyzer’s feature where you assign tests to hypotheses and track outcomes .
Integration with Data (future): In later versions, we could integrate directly with analytics or
project management tools to automatically ingest results (for instance, connect to marketing
analytics to see if the conversion metric hit 40% or not). In V1, a manual update or CSV import of
results is sufficient to change hypothesis status. The AI could assist by periodically reminding the
user of untested critical hypotheses or suggesting new hypotheses as the strategy evolves.
Goal: By having explicit hypotheses with validation plans, the strategy development shifts from
opinion-driven to evidence-driven. The presence of this module also nudges users to think in an
experiment mindset: “What would convince me that this assumption is true or false?” – a hallmark of
critical analytical thinking. It essentially helps companies adopt a scientific approach to strategy
(similar to how agile brought hypothesis-driven development to product).
Acceptance Criteria: Users should be able to create hypothesis entries linked to assumptions, with fields
for description, metric, and success criteria. In user testing, at least 90% of critical assumptions identified
should be converted into a clear testable hypothesis (or explicitly marked as “assumption to monitor” if not
immediately testable). The app should provide at least one relevant test suggestion for each hypothesis –
measured by user feedback on whether suggestions were helpful. Over a simulated project cycle, the status
of hypotheses can be updated and the system should clearly reflect progress (e.g. “3 of 5 critical hypotheses
validated, 1 invalidated, 1 pending”). We should also gauge if this feature drives action: e.g. beta users
report actually conducting tests or research they wouldn’t have otherwise, due to the app’s prompts (a
strong indicator of value).
6. Collaboration & Team Features
Requirement: Allow multiple users to collaborate on the same strategy project, and facilitate knowledge
sharing and debate within the app.
Description: Many strategies are developed in teams, so the app will support a multi-user
environment for each project (strategy document). Key collaboration features:
Shared Projects: A user (project owner) can invite others (with view or edit permissions) to join a
strategy project. Team members can then contribute to the inputs, assumptions list, hypothesis
tracker, etc.
Commenting & Threaded Debate: On any item (assumption, AI-generated question, hypothesis,
framework output), team members can leave comments or answers. For example, if the AI asks
“What if competitor responds by cutting prices?”, the CMO on the team might comment, “Our analysis
shows competitors have limited margin to cut prices; see attached data.” Another member can reply or
provide a counterpoint. This creates an audit trail of strategic discussions. It encourages
constructive debate, aligning with best practices that great strategies require frank discussion and
reasoning .
Assignment & Notifications: The project owner can assign certain questions or hypotheses to
individuals. E.g., flag an assumption for the CTO to review (“Tech feasibility: CTO to validate”). The

app will notify that person and track that it’s “in review” or “answered by [name]”. This ensures every
critical piece gets an owner – no stone is left unturned due to diffusion of responsibility.
Version History: The app keeps versions of the strategy content and even the AI session transcripts.
If the team pivots or updates the strategy, they can refer back to earlier assumptions or questions.
This is important for large organizations where strategies evolve – you maintain knowledge
continuity. For instance, “Last quarter, we assumed X, but now we learned Y; see hypothesis test result.”
The history log can be exported for compliance or learning purposes.
Privacy Controls: Within a company, maybe not all strategy collaborators should see everything (for
sensitive scenarios). The app will allow marking certain analysis or comments as private to certain
roles. However, our primary assumption is teams using it will mostly be open internally. Externally,
sharing might be limited to PDF reports rather than live access, to maintain control.
Collaboration Use Case: Think of a corporate strategy team of 5 using the app to prepare their
annual plan. Each person is responsible for one section (market analysis, financial model,
competitive landscape, etc.). They use the AI to challenge each section, then collectively review the
aggregated assumptions and risks. Team members debate points directly in the app comments. By
the end, the entire team has a shared understanding of the plan’s logic and weak points. This fosters
alignment – an AI-generated insight “competitor might respond with X” is seen by all, so Marketing,
Sales, Product are on the same page about competitive risk. Modern AI solutions enabling
synchronous collaboration on strategy help different functions align on goals from day one , so
including these features is key to drive adoption in enterprise settings.
Acceptance Criteria: Must support at least 5 concurrent collaborators on a project with real-time updates
(e.g. if one adds an assumption or comment, others see it nearly immediately). Permissions: at least two
roles (Owner/Edit and Comment/View) at launch. We will consider it successful if pilot teams report that
using the tool improved cross-functional alignment or surfaced misalignment early. A measurable proxy:
after using the app, teams have fewer major disagreements in live strategy meetings because many were
ironed out via the app’s process (hard to quantify for PRD, but we can collect anecdotal evidence). The
comment threads and assignments should be intuitive – if more than 10% of users struggle to find where to
discuss or how to assign tasks in testing, we’ll iterate the design. Finally, exporting/sharing: a team should
be able to export a “Strategy Brief” that includes the final plan plus an appendix of assumptions, risks, and
hypotheses (with or without internal comments, as needed) to share with executives or board, so all that
work is presented in a digestible format.
7. Security, Privacy, and Enterprise Readiness
Requirement: Implement robust security and privacy measures to protect sensitive strategic data, and
ensure the product can be adopted in enterprise environments with compliance needs.
Data Encryption & Access Control: All project data (strategy text, AI analysis transcripts, etc.) must
be stored encrypted at rest and in transit. We will use industry-standard encryption protocols
(AES-256 for data, TLS 1.2+ for network). Access to projects is limited to invited users; even within a
company, one team’s project is not accessible to another unless explicitly shared. We will provide
SSO integration (OAuth/SAML) for enterprise users to manage access via their identity provider. Rolebased access as mentioned (view vs edit rights) will be enforced in the backend for every action.

Privacy of Information: We commit that user-provided strategy information will never be used to
train the public AI model unless explicitly allowed. Many leaders will worry about feeding
proprietary ideas into an AI. To address this, our architecture can either use on-premise or private
instance LLM deployments for big clients, or at least ensure that API calls do not log content on
external servers. Offering an on-prem or VPC-deployed version might be crucial for industries like
banking or government. In initial SaaS version, we’ll likely use a secure cloud but could fine-tune a
model on general business data and then do inference on customer data in isolation (no
commingling). We will also allow users to purge data on demand (e.g. after a project ends, they
might delete it entirely).
Compliance: For enterprise sales, we should plan to comply with relevant standards (e.g. SOC 2 for
security processes, GDPR for data handling since strategies may contain personal or customer data,
possibly ISO27001). While not a feature per se, these are product requirements to gain trust.
Audit Logs: The system should maintain logs of who accessed or edited what (especially for
enterprise admin oversight). If an executive wants to see who on the team answered a particular AI
challenge or who changed an assumption, they can check the audit trail. This is not just for security
but also accountability in the strategy process.
Scalability & Performance: The app must handle potentially large strategy documents (tens of
pages of text) and multiple AI analysis threads without timeouts. We expect usage spikes around
planning seasons, so the backend should auto-scale. Performance requirement: initial analysis
(assumption extraction) on a reasonably sized input (~5-10 pages) should complete in under, say, 30
seconds. Follow-up AI queries (like each question in Devil’s advocate) should be near real-time (a few
seconds) to feel conversational. Caching techniques could be used for repeated analyses.
Reliability: For enterprise trust, aim for 99.5%+ uptime SLAs. Also, fail-safe behaviors: if the AI
service is down, the app should at least allow viewing existing content and perhaps queue analysis
to run later, rather than locking users out of their strategy data.
Acceptance Criteria: Security features are largely about compliance: we should pass a third-party security
audit or at least an internal checklist (encryption verified, etc.). From a user perspective, we want executives
to feel safe – we can measure that via the sales cycle or user feedback on trust. For example, beta clients
not raising red flags in security review is a pass criterion. Performance-wise, in testing the median response
time for AI queries should be <5 seconds, and p95 maybe <10 seconds, to keep interaction smooth. If any
large-language-model calls might be slower, we need spinners/progress indicators with clear messaging (so
user knows it’s working, not stuck).
8. User Interface & Experience
(While not a single “feature,” the UX is critical to adoption, so we outline key design requirements.)
Requirement: Design an intuitive UI that makes the process of analytical strategy review feel like a natural
conversation and visual brainstorming, rather than a burdensome form-filling exercise.
Conversational Interface: The core interaction with the AI challenger will take place in a chat-like
interface for familiarity (users have now experienced ChatGPT or similar). This window will display
the AI’s questions or comments, with the user able to type or select responses. It should also allow
referencing parts of the strategy or assumptions easily (perhaps by clicking on an assumption to see
related AI comments). We might implement two modes: a “guided mode” where the AI leads the user
through a semi-structured interview (good for novices), and a “free mode” where the user can ask the
AI open-ended questions or say “critique this section.”
•

Dashboard View: Alongside the conversation, users need a dashboard/panel showing the
structural elements: a list of assumptions (with status), list of hypotheses (with status), a list of
identified risks or questions. This could be a sidebar or a toggle view. For example, a user should be
able to switch to an “Assumptions tab” and drag-drop to prioritize them or mark ones as resolved.
The UI should highlight items needing attention (e.g. 3 critical assumptions untested in red).
Visualization: Where possible, present information visually. If we have that 2x2 of assumptions
(Critical vs Uncertainty), show it graphically. If a SWOT is done, show a four-quadrant grid. For
scenario outcomes, maybe a simple timeline or “alternate future” tree could be depicted. Visual cues
help busy leaders quickly grasp the outputs.
Clarity and Tone: The AI’s output (questions, summaries) should be phrased in clear, professional
language. We will avoid jargon unless the user’s content is jargon-heavy (the AI can mirror the user’s
style to some degree). The tone can also be adjustable: maybe a slider from “gentle” to “strict” for the
AI challenger’s tone. In early tests, we’ll find the right default; likely a neutral, factual tone with polite
phrasing like “Have we considered X?” rather than “This is wrong because X.”
Ease of Input: Users can input their strategy by typing/pasting text, but we also consider templates
to guide them. On login, the home screen might have options like “Start New Strategy” with prompts:
Goal, Scope, Key Initiatives, etc., to help those starting from scratch. Alternatively, a user could upload
a document (Word, PDF) and the app will parse it into sections. The friction to get started should be
minimal – the user should get some analysis within minutes of first use to see value immediately.
Onboarding & Help: The first-time user experience should include a quick tutorial, possibly
interactive: e.g., a sample strategy is provided, and the user can click through to see how
assumptions are identified and how to answer AI questions. We will also have help tooltips
explaining concepts (like what’s an assumption vs a hypothesis) so even non-MBA users can follow
along.
Device and Integration: Initially web app (desktop-focused, since writing strategy is heavy content
work). But ensure responsive design for at least viewing outputs on tablet. We might later have
integrations (like a plugin for Google Docs or Microsoft Word, where the AI can critique a draft
memo directly), but the PRD scope is the core web platform.
Acceptance Criteria: In UX testing, target high usability scores: e.g., System Usability Scale (SUS) > 80.
Users should be able to perform key tasks without confusion: identify assumptions, respond to an AI
question, find the results of a SWOT analysis. If more than say 10% of test users cannot figure out how to
use a major feature without guidance, we need to refine the design. The conversation flow should feel
engaging – aim for at least some users to voluntarily spend >30 minutes analyzing a strategy via the app
(indicative that it’s holding their attention like a real discussion). Subjectively, users should report that “the
app felt like a collaborator rather than a form” in feedback.
Competitive Landscape
The concept of an AI-driven strategic thinking tool is nascent, but there are a few categories of tools and
approaches worth noting:
Manual Framework Tools: Products like Strategyzer, Board of Innovation’s toolkit, etc., provide
digital canvases and templates (e.g. Business Model Canvas, assumption mapping worksheets). They
emphasize identifying hypotheses and tracking tests . However, these tools rely on the user
to do the thinking – they don’t actively critique or generate insights. Our app differentiates by using
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

13
AI to fill in the gaps and ask the questions that users might not think of on their own. We go from a
passive documentation tool to an active analytical partner.
Generic AI Chatbots (e.g. ChatGPT): Some leaders have started using general AI to ask strategic
questions. For example, one might prompt ChatGPT “Here’s my strategy, what are the flaws?”. This can
yield some results, but generic AI lacks contextual tuning and often gives surface-level or generic
advice. Moreover, privacy is a concern using public AI with confidential data. Our product offers a
specialized LLM fine-tuned for business strategy analysis and with guardrails for factuality and
privacy. The knowledge of frameworks and common business pitfalls is built-in, giving more depth
and relevance than a generic AI session. Also, we integrate the AI with structured project
management (assumptions list, etc.), which a plain chatbot doesn’t do.
Enterprise Strategy Software (OKR and Execution Tools): Tools like Quantive (Gtmhub),
WorkBoard, Cascade, etc., focus on strategy execution – tracking OKRs, KPIs, and projects to
ensure the strategy is implemented. They sometimes include features to input strategic plans or do
SWOT, but their primary use is monitoring execution and alignment. They typically do not provide
critical feedback on the plan content itself. Our app complements these: we operate upstream, to
make sure the strategy is solid before you lock in your OKRs. In the long run, integration with such
tools could be beneficial (e.g. pulling actual KPI data to update hypothesis outcomes).
AI Strategy Startups: This is an emerging space. For example, NexStrat AI (2025) positions itself as
an AI co-pilot for strategy teams . Their focus seems to be on data integration and generating
strategic options, following a consultant-like approach. They highlight features like scenario analysis
and automatically generating strategy documents . Our product would compete in this arena
but with a possibly different angle: NexStrat emphasizes data-heavy analysis (analytics dashboards,
etc.), whereas our initial focus is on critical reasoning and assumption challenges (the “human
logic” side of strategy). We believe there is a niche for a tool that business people use not for
number-crunching but for thought-crunching. That said, NexStrat validating market interest is a
positive sign. We’ll differentiate by possibly targeting a slightly smaller customer (mid-market vs.
Fortune 100) at first, a lighter-weight deployment (SaaS self-service vs heavy enterprise sales), and a
user experience that feels like a conversation rather than a complex enterprise software. We will
keep an eye on others like strategygpt-type tools or academic projects in decision intelligence.
Consulting Firms’ Internal Tools: Big consulting companies often develop their own AI and
knowledge management tools to aid their consultants. It’s possible they build something similar inhouse to boost their teams (McKinsey’s article hints they are exploring AI in strategy development
roles ). However, these are unlikely to be offered to end clients as software. Our strategy to
handle this is to actually partner or market to boutique consultancies – rather than fight them,
enable them. Some consulting firms could white-label or use our platform to deliver more value to
their clients (e.g., run the client’s strategy through our app as part of a workshop). So, while
consultants are competitors in problem-solving service, they can be allies in tool adoption.
In summary, no single existing tool currently provides the blend of automated critical analysis,
collaborative hypothesis tracking, and strategic guidance that we envision. We are effectively creating a
new category of “AI Strategy Coach.” The competitive risk is that others will also enter this space as AI tech
advances; hence, speed to market and building proprietary expertise (e.g., fine-tuning our AI on a corpus of
strategic plans and outcomes) will be key. By integrating the wisdom of established frameworks with

cutting-edge AI, our product aims to be the go-to solution for leaders who want to ensure their strategy is
rock-solid before execution – something that neither static templates nor generic chatbots or execution
software currently deliver.
Success Metrics
To gauge the product’s success, we will track a combination of user engagement metrics, outcome
metrics, and qualitative feedback:
Adoption and Engagement: Number of active strategy projects in the system, and the frequency of
usage. E.g., a successful pattern might be a user logging in multiple times over a few weeks to
iteratively refine a strategy. We’ll track DAU/WAU (daily/weekly active users) in target organizations
during pilot. High engagement would indicate that users find continuous value (not just one-anddone). If a typical strategic planning cycle is quarterly, we’d expect at least a few sessions per quarter
per user, but ideally, users find reason to use it weekly (perhaps with multiple initiatives).
Depth of Use: Metrics like number of assumptions identified per project, number of AI questions
generated/answered, number of hypotheses logged. These indicate whether the tool is actually
being used for deep analysis versus superficially. For example, if on average 15 assumptions and 10
hypotheses are recorded for each strategy, and perhaps 5 critical questions addressed, that
suggests substantive engagement. If we see projects with only 1-2 assumptions, that might mean
users aren’t using the tool fully (or the strategy was very small in scope).
Outcome Improvement (Qualitative/Binary): Ultimately, we’d love to measure if strategies that
went through the app perform better (e.g. fewer failures, faster time to decision pivots). In the short
term, we will rely on user testimonials and case studies. Success looks like: “Our team identified a
major go-to-market risk using the app that we hadn’t considered – addressing it saved us an estimated $X
or a six-month delay.” Or a user saying, “I walked into the board meeting much more confident because I
had answers ready for the tough questions.” During pilot programs, we’ll collect such stories. We could
also attempt a controlled experiment: one set of teams uses the app, a control group doesn’t, and
see if decision quality (perhaps rated by their leadership) differs. But that may be hard to quantify. At
minimum, a Net Promoter Score (NPS) from users about whether the product makes their strategy
better can be gathered – aiming for an NPS of >50 in the pilot phase if we truly deliver value.
Retention and Expansion: If users use it once and abandon it, that’s failure. We aim for strong
retention: e.g., 80% of teams that use it for one planning cycle use it again for the next cycle. Also,
within an organization, we’d measure expansion: one team’s success leads to more teams using it
(number of licenses expanding quarter over quarter in a company, for enterprise sales). In the
consultant scenario, perhaps one office of a firm uses it, then it spreads to other offices (via word of
mouth). High expansion and low churn means the product isn’t just a novelty – it’s becoming an
embedded part of the strategic process.
AI Effectiveness (Quality metrics): Although harder to measure objectively, we will monitor the
relevance of AI outputs via user feedback. For instance, after an AI Q&A session, we can prompt
the user: “Did the AI’s questions help improve your strategy? Rate 1-5.” Similarly, after scenario
generation: “Were these scenarios useful to consider?” Consistently high ratings (4+ out of 5) would
•
•
•
•
•
15
indicate the AI is hitting the mark. If certain types of suggestions are ignored or deleted often, we
know to fine-tune those.
Time Savings: One selling point is doing rigorous analysis faster. We can ask users or measure
proxies for time saved. For example, time taken to produce a strategy document or decision might
reduce with the app. If normally a team spends 4 weeks in research and debate, maybe with the app
they conclude in 3 weeks because the AI accelerated the challenge process. We could survey: “Do you
feel the app saved you time in the analysis phase? How much?” If we gather estimates like “saved 20% of
our time” or “allowed us to reallocate hours to creative thinking instead of defensive analysis,” that
supports our value proposition.
Community and Referrals: Because this is somewhat a novel approach, a metric of success is if
users talk about it and recommend it. If we see organic referrals (each new customer citing an existing
user who recommended it) or positive mentions in professional forums (e.g. LinkedIn, industry
conferences), that’s a strong indicator we have product-market fit. We might track how many
inbound inquiries or sign-ups come from word-of-mouth.
By continuously monitoring these metrics, we’ll not only validate that the product is meeting its objectives
but also learn where to refine. For instance, if engagement is high but hypothesis testing usage is low,
perhaps that feature needs better UX or advocacy. If users aren’t retaining, maybe the AI needs to provide
more immediate “wow” insights early on. Our ultimate success vision is that within 2-3 years, having an AI
strategy assistant becomes a best practice for companies – much like having automated testing is for
software – and our product is synonymous with that use case. Business leaders would wonder how they
ever planned critical initiatives without having their thinking partner to catch blind spots and strengthen
their logic.
Risks & Open Questions
While the potential is high, we acknowledge several risks and open questions at this stage:
User Skepticism & Change Management: Some experienced executives might be hesitant or even
insulted by the idea that an AI can critique their strategy. There’s a risk they see it as “extra work” or
an implicit criticism of their thinking. We need to handle this via product positioning (it’s a tool to
assist you, not judge you) and possibly a configurable AI tone as mentioned. During onboarding, we
might need to explicitly encourage users to embrace a growth mindset (“Better the AI finds a flaw
than your boss or the market does!”). We will gather feedback on this perception and may
incorporate a mode where the AI first praises strengths of the strategy before hitting weaknesses,
to soften the experience. The risk is if key users reject the premise outright, adoption will stall.
Mitigation: target innovation-friendly users first, provide strong success stories to win over skeptics,
and ensure the AI’s feedback is high quality and respectful so that even skeptics see its value.
AI Accuracy and Hallucinations: The AI might sometimes generate incorrect or irrelevant critiques
(hallucinations), especially if the input is sparse or ambiguous. If it confidently states a false insight
(e.g. citing a “market trend” that isn’t real), it could mislead users. This is dangerous in strategy. To
mitigate this, our design insists on transparent reasoning – e.g., the AI should phrase things as
questions or possibilities, not factual assertions, unless backed by data. We might include a feature
where the AI provides a confidence or references: “We lack data here, but a potential concern is X.” If

integrating external data, we should cite sources (as McKinsey example queries with sources ).
We’ll also likely use a fine-tuned model constrained to business language to reduce off-the-wall
outputs, and test extensively on known case studies (comparing AI analysis to actual known
outcomes to calibrate it). Still, we must have a disclaimer that the AI is an aid, not an oracle. The
product should encourage users to double-check critical recommendations. Over time, with more
usage data, we can refine and even implement a feedback mechanism where users mark an AI
question as “not relevant” which retrains future output.
Scope Creep (Focus): Strategy is broad – from high-level vision down to operational tactics – and
different users might wish for different features (some might want heavy data analysis and
forecasting, others want purely qualitative critique). We have to be careful to nail the core use case
(critical thinking support) rather than trying to do everything at once. For example, this PRD
outlines a wide array of features. We will likely prioritize the ones that deliver the most unique value
(assumption mapping, AI challenge, pre-mortem) in the MVP, and potentially phase others (full
hypothesis tracking, deep frameworks library) in subsequent releases or as beta features. Risk is if
we overextend, the product could become too complex or diluted. The PRD priorities will be revisited
to ensure a coherent MVP.
Data Integration and Company-Specific Knowledge: One open question is how much the AI
should incorporate external knowledge. Some strategy critiques require knowing the industry or
competitor info. In MVP, we rely on the user to input relevant data (it can ask “who are your
competitors?” and then reason). In the future, a competitive advantage would be integrating realtime market intelligence (news, financial data) to make the AI’s advice smarter. We need to validate if
early users expect this. It’s complex to implement and raises additional accuracy risk, so likely out-ofscope for V1. We will make it clear that initial version is “BYO data” – the AI will help think through
whatever info is given. If users have to manually provide contextual data, will they? Possibly strategy
teams have plenty of PowerPoints and reports; a pipeline to ingest those could be a mid-term
feature. This remains an area for research during the pilot: how to best incorporate domain
knowledge without AI going off course.
Competition and Differentiation: As mentioned, the space is heating up. A big risk is a major
player (like an existing enterprise software company or a well-funded startup) doing something
similar and outpacing us. To mitigate, we focus on speed to a lovable product and leveraging our
unique insight (the critical thinking angle). We also consider network effects – maybe a community
feature where strategies (anonymized) can be compared or a benchmark of assumptions by industry
(if we accumulate data) – that could moats over time. It’s too early to commit, but keeping an eye on
how to maintain competitive edge is important. For now, user experience and depth of analysis
will be our differentiation.
Legal Liability: If our AI advises on strategy, and a company still fails or loses money, could they
blame the tool? We will include appropriate disclaimers (human decision ultimately, AI is a guide).
But we also have to be careful that the AI doesn’t output anything that could be interpreted as legal/
financial advice or HR-sensitive etc. We’ll restrict the use cases to business strategy (not personal
finance, not something like hiring/firing advice directly). Nonetheless, good practice is to have users
acknowledge it’s not liable for outcomes. This is standard, but worth noting.

By recognizing these risks and addressing them proactively in design and messaging, we increase our
chances of delivering a truly valuable product.
Conclusion & Next Steps
In conclusion, this PRD outlines a comprehensive vision for an Analytical Strategy Thinking App that has
the potential to transform how business leaders approach strategic planning. By embedding critical
thinking frameworks into an AI-driven interactive experience, we aim to help users catch flaws in their logic,
uncover blind spots, and ultimately make more robust strategic decisions. The need for such a tool is
evident from both the struggles leaders report in crafting solid strategies and the early moves in
industry towards AI-assisted planning .
The next steps will be to prioritize core features for an MVP (likely: Assumption Mapping, AI Challenger, and
basic Hypothesis Tracker as the primary triad) and begin development with careful attention to the UX
simplicity and AI reliability. We will also start recruiting a small group of pilot users (perhaps strategy teams
in a few tech companies or VC portfolio companies) to test early prototypes on real scenarios. Their
feedback will be invaluable in refining the product.
If successful, this app could become an indispensable “second mind” for leaders – a safeguard against
strategic errors and a means to sharpen thinking in an era where the competitive advantage will
belong to those who can outthink and outlearn the competition. We’re building not just a product, but
hopefully fostering a culture of rigorous, hypothesis-driven strategy in the business world, augmented by
AI.
